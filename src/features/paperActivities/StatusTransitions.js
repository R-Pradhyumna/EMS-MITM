 * Lookup-table that maps paper "status" and user "role" to:
 *  - label: Button/action label to show in UI (e.g. Approve, Lock)
 *  - update: Function that takes the paper and returns the status/state update object
 *  - confirm: Function that returns the confirmation string for the checkbox
 *
 * Used by ApprovePaper and role-specific approval screens.
